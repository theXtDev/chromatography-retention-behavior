- A series of comparisons between different proposed models to predict retention behavior of both reverese phase and normal phase LC
- Comparing an original model driven from Maixma Overcome Theory with other models such as LSS, log-log, mixed-mode, quadratic and neue-kuss model
- Comparisons are delivered in isocratic and gradient modes
- RPLC and HILIC driven data are both tested and validated on MOT model
